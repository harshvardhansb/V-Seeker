## Problem Statement
Develop a web-based platform for matching volunteers with local community service projects based on their skills and interests.

## Description:
The platform should allow volunteers to create profiles outlining their skills, availability, and interests. Community service projects should be able to post opportunities and requirements. The platform should use algorithms to match volunteers with relevant projects.

#Problem Inspiration
Many people are interested in volunteering their time and skills to support their local communities but may struggle to find opportunities that align with their skills and interests. A platform that can effectively match volunteers with relevant projects can help address this issue.
